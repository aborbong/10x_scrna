title: Data processing of cellranger count results

```{r Quality control}
#This step includes two stages of filtering: Cell filtering, and Gene filtering. For the first step, it filters out low-quality cells based on the following parameters: 
#1. Number of detected genes
#2. Percentage of mitochondrial genes
#3. Total UMI (Unique Molecular Identifier) counts

#For the second filtering-stage, genes with a low prevalence of expression across cells will be filtered out to reduce noise
